# GenCross
A Script to tabulate genetic exercises related to Mendel's laws.

### Requirements ⚙️

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run 🏁

```bash
python GenCross.py
```

## Example:
If Pedro has straight hair and his parents have curly hair, the straight character cannot be dominant. Pedro will be rr and his parents, Rr, since they have curly hair and have had a son, Pedro, with straight hair.
Mar has curly hair (R-) and her father is straight (rr), so Mar will have to be heterozygous (Rr) for this character.

```bash
Genotype 1: r, r
Genotype 2: R, r
     r   r
R   Rr  rr
r   Rr  rr
```
